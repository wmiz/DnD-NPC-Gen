# DnD-NPC-Gen
A web app that Generates NPCs for Fifth Edition Dungeons and Dragons.

## Motivation
When I'm GMing I often prepare NPCs before sessions using the D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I have tried using some other tools online to do so, and while they are great in a lot of ways, they often include many NPC traits than those suggested in the DMG. This project strives to stick to D&D rules as written for NPC generation.

## Features
### Current
Generates the following NPC traits:
* Name
* Race
* Sex
* Age
* Appearance
* High and low abilities
* Talents
* Mannerisms
* Interactions with others
* Ideals
* Bonds
* Flaws

### Future
Will generate the following NPC traits:
* Occupation and history
* Useful knowledge

Provide UI for creating and modifying new NPCs.
